Theresa Dueno Final Website

## Final Website
This final website is a portfolion for my design work through University of Florida.

## Homepage
The homepage is a simple 'About Me' section.

## Portfolio
The portfolio features a lightbox containing all the images of projects I've worked on throughout the year.

## Contact Me
The contact me page has a contact form where you can provide your contact information and reach out to me.

## Animation
The animation didn't fit with my regular website design.  This page will feature a simple animation going from left to right of the page.

### Thank you!
Thank you Professor Efren.  This class was challenging as a first time coder, but it was a lot of fun! Happy Holidays!
